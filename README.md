#Catch the Ball
By: Oyindamola Bade-Ojo, Parvathy Santhosh, Kahalan Edwards

What is it?
This is a game  program written entirely in Java that employs JOptionPane instead of command line outputs.
This app has three main functions:
1. Catch the ball
2. Catch the ball on time
3. Get a high score

 How does it work?
 Boucne.java
This is the main class of the program and calls the other classes. It also defines the path variables used in the rest of the program. 

 Ball .java 
This class adminsters the balls, the shapes of the balls and how they fall

 Sqaure.java
This class administers how the square moves to catch the balls, and the width and height

Welcome.java
The class is the welcome page, how the color is expected to be and the size of the picture 

 Goodbye.java
This class shows the player whether they won the game or lost


 How to run it?
1. Make sure you have Java and a Java IDE downloaded
2. Download ALL files in this repository (with the exception of the README.md) and make sure they are all in the same folder/location
3. Replace path variables with the path that is specific to your computer
4. Open all .java files and run program according to your IDE

 Thank you!
